* Introduction
  - Image-based visual tracking aims to identify the motion of an
    object as it passes through a camera's field of view.
  - Several approaches:
	- Feature based
	  - Use an algorithm like SIFT to identify "interesting features"
	  - Try to match features between frames
	  - deduce motion from the consensus
	  - robust to occlusions
	  - But... struggle when the target does not have many
        "interesting features"
	- Template based
	  - We are given a template image
	  - Goal is to align the template image to each frame of the video
	  - Alignment (or warping) parameters are used as the description
        of motion
	  - Optimal alignment is defined in terms of minimizing some loss
        between the template and the frame.

  - [ ] Probably need to think of some small improvements to the
        algorithm otherwise performance will be terrbile
